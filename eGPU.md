# external GPU

In the Robolab an external GPU is available, which can be used for machine learning applications. In addition, two workstations with good internal GPUs are available as rapid prototyping machines. Those machines are described in another document (README.md). The benefit of an external GPU is that you can use your own laptop, the downside is that your laptop needs at least a Tunderbolt interface and that you have to some additional configuration.

# Interface

The Razor Core has an 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 cable. Physically it is an USB-C interface, but not every USB-C port is an Thunderbolt port.
A Thunderbolt port can be recognized with a lighting symbol. Inside your laptop the Thunderbolt port is connected with the  PCIe 3.0 lanes. If your laptop connects 4 PCIe lanes, you can make use of the full 40Gbps.

Older Macs typically have a Thunderbolt 2 interface. There is a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 converter available, together with a Thunderbolt 2 cable.

# Location
The machine is located in the Robolab, room C3.165.
