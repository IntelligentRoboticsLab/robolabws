# external TPU

In the Robolab an external TPU is available, which can be used for mobile machine learning applications. 
In addition, an external GPU (<a href=https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLab/robolabws/blob/master/eGPU.md> eGPU.md</a>) and four workstations with good internal GPUs are available as rapid prototyping machines (<a href=https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLab/robolabws/blob/master/README.md>README.md</a>).
This external TPU is meant to be able to use pretrained models on your mobile device (iOS or Android), because coprocessors are typically not available on mobile devices.
The downside is that you have to do cross-development on your laptop and port your code than to the mobile device.
